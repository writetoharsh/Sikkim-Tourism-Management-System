# Sikkim-Tourism-Management-System

# 1. Start Navigating from Registration_Form.html. Here there is a button named Already Registered?( So here I have used the concept of local storage).
# 2. After registering we land on website.html. Here there is a slide show and the photos of the developers. On the top is a navigation bar( for now 'Seeing Places' has no page as we will work on it next week, Map of Sikkim is pending( I couldn't figure out Google Maps JavaScript API, hope muksam does xD).
# 3. Click on Hotel Preferences, we land on Hotel_Preferences.html. Now over here I again used local storage( don't ask me why I did it, I just did it :P). 
# 4. Click on Car Preferences, we land on Car_Preferences.html. Now over here I again used local storage( don't ask me why I did it, I just did it :P :) ). After filling the details for the car and clicking on "Book Vehicle" we land on Checkout.html. And after clicking on Confirm? we land on Thank_You.html.
# 5. Now in website.html there is a link on the navigation bar named Contact Us. We land on Contact_Us.html( Now here is where I couldn't figure out anything). 
# Note - Backend Developer, please make any change in the front end if you feel like changing. Thank You.

# Backend Developers please help.
